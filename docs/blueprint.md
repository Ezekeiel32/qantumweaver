# **App Name**: Quantum Weaver

## Core Features:

- AI Model Configuration Assistant: Advise users on how to configure a model based on dataset properties, suggest modifications and an appropriate batch size, and indicate any relevant changes to make using training paramater setting AI.
- Hilbert Space Quantum Neural Network Parameter Advisor: Provide appropriate guidance to set momentum and coupling ZPE from previous trainings AI tool. This function analyzes the effectiveness to allow a human expert in the area for the ability to optimize and adjust models for increased gains to both accuracy, precision, and reduction in memory usage.
- Simulate Zero-Point Energy: Implement a pseudo-quantum circuit simulation (using cirq, pennylane, or plain binary shifting), display the resulting output in the appropriate interface, with an option for different visualizers (histogram, raw numbers) all configurable and running from UI panel
- Colab ZPE Model Quantization: With quantization and high-gain metrics extract model as potential target from Colab notebook. Apply tool to identify high gain components and showcase the effects of each.
- Third-party Cloud GPU Intergration: Allow an API connection option to third party systems for live compute analysis, such as a link to vast.ai. It means setting up appropriate forms, validation functions, and options
- Enhanced Visualization Interface: Give high quality display results from analysis from implemented Pytorch data set binary and present key insight from those binary states that otherwise remain untapped. Also to add adaptive perturbation for colab components
- Holographic UX and Chart Display: In the UI display real time hologram results with functional use that helps enhance usability and provide new intuitive UX elements. To display all types of information - data from a tensor being manipulated into code output that shows up instantly through the holographic components all live. All displayed on an appropriate 3D chart

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E479A), representing high technology.
- Background color: Dark gray (#292933), ensuring data is easily readable.
- Accent color: Light blue (#A0D4F5), highlighting interactive parts.
- Use clean, sans-serif fonts, along with monospace fonts for appropriate code or data snippets: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for code.
- Line-based futuristic icons, taking cues from lucide.dev for simplicity.
- Create a quantum RF-system-inspired dashboard with panels and modular elements. Focus on usability and functionality
- Use holographic transitions to animate metrics, charts, and graphs.
